            <div class="p"> Contrast is the range of brightness, from lightest to darkest, in an image. A high-contrast image will have very bright highlights and very dark shadows. Sometimes an image’s highlights may be almost pure white, or the shadows may be almost pure black: high contrast. Other times, the lightest and darkest points in an image may be far from white or black: a low-contrast image.</div>
            <div class="p">Contrast isn’t always about monotone shades of light. You can have contrasting colors and tones within any lighting condition, too! This gets more into things like the zone system and color theory, which are wholly different subjects. Thankfully, there are plenty of articles about how to use complementary colors, and how to use color to create stunning photos in general.

                Here is the key to it all: in any lighting condition, tones and colors can create different levels of contrast. Sometimes, a particular color is distracting. It isn’t in harmony with the rest of the image. You might try cropping it out of the frame, or converting the image to black and white.

            <div class="p">Remember, although it is important to “get it right” with contrast in photographs, it is a tool with immense diversity. Almost everything is subjective and dependent upon your creative vision!

                The best thing you can do is, simply notice and understand how contrast affects each photo you capture, and how it grabs the viewer’s attention.</div>
