            <div class="h">What is ISO?</div>
            <div class="p">ISO is an interesting one. It brightens your photos, but it is not part of your “luminous exposure,” since it does not affect the amount of light that reaches your camera sensor (the definition of exposure). Instead, it merely brightens a photo in-camera after your sensor has already been exposed to the light.</div>
            <div class="p">The ISO scale is easy to remember. At higher numbers, your photos will be brighter, but you also will see more and more noise. The main stops on the ISO scale are 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200, and 6400. Some cameras go beyond this range, in either direction, such as the ISO 25,600 image above. Also, you can set intermediate ISO values at 1/3 or 1/2 stops, such as ISO 640 or ISO 1250.</div>
            <div class="pic"></div>
            <div class="p">ISO is highly technical at the sensor level, but that isn’t important to know when you’re starting out. Instead, just use it like you would expect. Keep your ISO at the base value whenever possible. But, if your exposure (shutter speed and aperture) will not result in a bright enough photo, it is time to raise the ISO.</div>
