            <div class="p"> By adjusting the focus on your camera either manually or automatically, you can change where this plane of focus falls. Adjusting the focus can lead to sharper images, or, if handled in a specific way, create depth of field and emphasize just one part of an image while blurring everything behind it.</div>
            <div class="p">In most cameras, focusing takes place within the lens, which does the job of bending light onto the camera sensor, capturing a miniature representation of the real scene in front of it. The subject of your image is in your plane of focus when all the reflected light from that subject perfectly converges onto the sensor at a single point. When the subject falls outside the plane of focus, the light converges somewhere before or behind the sensor, resulting in a blur.</div>
            <div class="pic" style="background-image: url('/focuss.jpg'); background-size: cover;"></div>
            <div class="p">Focusing a camera is all about changing the distance between the subject of the image, the lens, and the sensor. The photographer can do this by adjusting the camera settingsâ€”or simply moving closer or further away from their subject.</div>
