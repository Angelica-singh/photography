            <div class="h">What is Exposure?</div>
            <div class="p">In photography, exposure is the amount of light that reaches your camera sensor or film. It is a crucial part of how bright or dark your pictures appear.</div>
            <div class="p">There are only two camera settings that affect how much light you capture (apart from your flash): shutter speed and aperture. The third setting, your ISO, doesn’t technically change how much light you capture, but it still affects the brightness of your photos. It is equally important to understand. Also, you can brighten or darken a photo by editing it in software on your computer, or by changing the amount of light in the scene in front of you.</div>

            <div class="p">Finally, if you really want to master exposure, reading about it isn’t enough. You also need to go out into the field and practice what you’ve learned. There’s no quick-and-dirty way to pick up a skill like this. But if you can lay a solid groundwork, you’ll be at a huge advantage when you go out and practice it for yourself. The goal of this comprehensive article is to teach you all the basics that you need to know about exposure.</div>
