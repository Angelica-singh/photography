            <div class="h">What is Sharpness?</div>
            <div class="p">sharpness is how clearly detail is rendered in a photograph.

                Thatâ€™s it! Sharpness is impacted by camera resolution, lens acutance, and more. But the sharpness of an image is simply a matter of detail in the final photograph.</div>
            <div class="p">Sharpness describes the clarity of detail in a photo, and can be a valuable creative tool for emphasizing texture. Proper photographic and post-processing technique can go a long way towards improving sharpness, although sharpness is ultimately limited by your camera equipment, image magnification and viewing distance. Two fundamental factors contribute to the perceived sharpness of an image: resolution and acutance.</div>
            <div class="pic" style="background-image: url('/sharp.jpg'); background-size: cover;"></div>
            <div class="p">Sharpness is also significantly affected by your camera technique. Even small amounts of camera shake can dramatically reduce the sharpness of an image. Proper shutter speeds, use of a sturdy camera tripod and mirror lock-up can also significantly impact the sharpness of your prints.</div>
