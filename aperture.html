            <div class="h">What is Aperture?</div>
            <div class="p">The larger your aperture, the brighter your photo – the more light you capture. Again, your pupils work just like this, too; they open or close to let in different amounts of light. So, when you are trying to expose a photo properly, it is crucial to pay attention to your aperture setting.</div>
            <div class="p">A large aperture lets in more light. Apertures like f/1.4 and f/2 practically let you see in the dark. On the flip side, a small aperture like f/16 (with nearly closed aperture blades) lets in far less light. If you try to photograph Milky Way at f/16, your final image will be essentially black.

                By changing your aperture and shutter speed settings, you can capture exactly the amount of light you want – resulting in a photo with the proper exposure. That is what makes aperture so powerful.</div>
            <div class="pic" style="background-image: url(/aperture.jpg); background-size: cover;"></div>
            <div class="p">It is very important to remember that aperture is a fraction. This is the biggest mistake beginners make when they talk about aperture. If you get this wrong, it will be difficult to remember how aperture works or use it yourself to capture the right exposure in the field.</div>
