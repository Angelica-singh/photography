            <div class="h">What is Shutter Speed?</div>
            <div class="p">Shutter speed is the length of time the camera shutter is open, exposing light onto the camera sensor. Essentially, it’s how long your camera spends taking a photo. This has a few important effects on how your images will appear.</div>
            <div class="p">When you use a long shutter speed (also known as a “slow” shutter speed), you end up exposing your sensor for a significant period of time. The first big effect of it is motion blur. If your shutter speed is long, moving subjects in your photo will appear blurred along the direction of motion. This effect is used quite often in advertisements of cars and motorbikes, where a sense of speed and motion is communicated to the viewer by intentionally blurring the moving wheels.

            <div class="p">The nice thing about shutter speed is that you can make it as slow as you want if you need more light. The same thing is not true of aperture, because once you hit your lens’s maximum aperture, you can’t open your aperture up any more. And besides, you may not want to change your aperture since it will change your depth of field. When I need a bit more light, my first thought goes to shutter speed.</div>
