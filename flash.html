            <div class="p">In photography, a flash is an artificial light source used to illuminate a scene or subject, especially in low-light conditions. The flash provides a burst of bright light that helps to enhance the exposure of the image, ensuring that subjects are well-lit and details are visible.</div>
            <div class="p">The flash operates by emitting a short, intense burst of light that coincides with the camera's shutter opening. This brief duration of light helps to illuminate the subject without causing overexposure. Proper flash synchronization is crucial, ensuring that the flash fires at the right moment relative to the camera's shutter speed.</div>
            <div class="pic" style="background-image: url('/flashh.avif'); background-size: cover;"></div>
            <div class="p">Flash helps you to use another dimension in your photography. While at times you do not have any other choice but use flash, I encourage every photographer out there to leave some room to be creative. Regardless of the type of photography you do, it is just another skill that will keep you challenged and motivated to do something different.</div>
